Dual Space Gradient Descent
===========================

This Python code implements Dual Space Gradient Descent (DualSGD), presented in the paper "Dual Space Gradient Descent for Online Learning" accepted at the 29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016).

The code is tested on Windows-based operating system with Python 2.7. Please make sure that you have installed *python-numpy* and *sklearn* to run the example.

Run the demo using this command
-------------------------------------
	python run_dsgd.py
